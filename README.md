# Custom Search Backend
### Custom Search
This Github Repository is used as a Backend for my Vercel Search app which allows for full Customization.
It has a default config and saves using URL Paramaters
An example of these url paramaters is and not limited to ?theme=dark or ?theme=dark&search_engine=google
You can find the website [here](https://search-pi-ochre.vercel.app/)
